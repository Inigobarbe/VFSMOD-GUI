C     This program solves the kinetic wave aproximation of the Saint-        C
C     Vennant's (1881) equations for overland flow (KW) for the 1-D case     C
C     as  presented by Lighthill and Whitham (1955) such as:                 C
C                                                                            C

C     Then the momentum equation is used as a link between the two           C
C     variables since then we have (Manning's):                              C

C                                                                            C

C     The numerical method is based on a N+2 upwinding Petrov-Galerkin       C

C     and a time weighting finite difference approximation for the time      C

C     The non-linearity of the equation {q=q(h)} is taken care of using      C

C     5- solve for [A],{b} to get a {x} for that time step                   C
C     6- Repeat 4 & 5 until convergence of that time step                    C

C     The overland flow solution is linked to a submodel to calculate        C
